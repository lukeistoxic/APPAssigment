# APPAssigment
Repository for Application Programming
Extension list split for UI and Logic from barebones requirements:

UI
  - Human and computer scores stored in key at bottom left side of the screen, in their corresponding player box colours.
  - Winner is displayed with their corresponding score in the top of the screen upon game completion.
  - view class (GameView) is used to display elements on the screen instead of Main Activity.
  
Logic
  - Class created (AIRandom) that decides the computer's move. AI chooses has preference for boxes that have three drawn lines.

--NOTE-- 
At the start of the project, I accidently created a second library but I immediately deleted it. Occasionally Android Studio looks for it, if you see a pop up upon loading Android Studio looking for 'lib2', please ignore it. It doesn't affect the program at all. My apologies for this.
